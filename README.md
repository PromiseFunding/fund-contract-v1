<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

This is the first contract for YieldMe - a trustless, decentralized, and lossless crowdfunding platform. Users can stake their ERC20 funds in a project they believe in and the funds are deposited into a Lending Protocol or alternative decentralized yield generating source. The proceeds generated by the yield accumulation are then made available to the benefactor to fund their project. In future iterations users will be able to get incentives based on their average contribution over time, promoting a productive and sustainable system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To run this contract follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Install yarn
  ```sh
npm install --global yarn
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YieldMe/fund-contract-v1.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
3. Make a copy of the `.env.example` file called `.env` and populate it with your keys. You can get your private key from MetaMask and RPC Urls from [alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Deploying YieldFund
Choose a network when deploying with YieldFund. If you're using a network that isn't already in the `hardhat.config.ts` and the `helper-hardhat-config.ts` you have to define the network as the other networks are defined.

1. Deploy (and compile) contract
```
hh deploy --network {network}
```
2. Run tests
```
hh test --network {network}
```
You can run the tests on three different networks at the moment. `goerli` which requires no additional setup other than deploying YieldFund to the network, `hardhat` which is similarly straightforward, but requires the deployment of mocks, and `localhost` which requires you launching the [aave-sandbox](https://github.com/aave/aave-sandbox/) forked environement.

---
## Mocks
This contract comes with several Mocks which together simulate a Mock AAVE pool. This is extremely useful because it allows you to test the YieldFund protocol in an environment which you have complete control over. To best use the mocks, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the test network.
```
hh node
```
#### This will deploy all three mock contracts, along with the YieldFund contract. It will supply the deployer (account #1) with mock USDT tokens. When you run the command, it will split out 20 accounts in the console, with the deployer being Account #0. To access this account's funds add the account's private key to your metamask.
2. Run the frontend by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/YieldMe/fund-me-frontend-v1/blob/master/README.md).
3. Using the deployer account that you added to metamask, deposit some USDT into the YieldFund contract.
4. If you would like to withdraw from the fund, you must do so after the `lockTime` is complete. To bypass the locktime, run the following command:
```
hh run scripts/bypassLocktime.ts --network localhost
```
5. In the production version of YieldFund, yield will be generated via gaining interest from a Liquidity Pool. Since there is of course no borrowing party on these mocks, we have to simulate the interest payout in order to withdraw proceeds from YieldFund. We can do so by running:
```
hh run scripts/payout.ts --network localhost 
```
